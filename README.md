##  Description 
This application enables business owners to efficiently manage departments, roles, and employees within their company. The database is built with MySQL and seamlessly interacts with JavaScript through the sequelize dependency. By utilizing this approach, the need for complex and convoluted query statements is eliminated, despite the initial effort required for file structuring and table connections. including the ability to update employee managers, view employees by manager or department, delete departments, roles, and employees from the database, and calculate the total utilized budget of a department, representing the combined salaries of its employees.

This node.js application uses MySQL2 and Inquirer to store, retrieve, and edit company data (employees, roles, departments) in an SQL database.
